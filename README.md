# What does this program do?

This program demostrates multithreading performance on MacOS. The program follows producer & consumer.

## Known Limitations

The program *Should* only be able to run on a UNIX based OS. This is because the multithreading platform being used is PThread. **IF** one were to run this on an MS-DOS based OS, DWORD would be used as its platform. 

## How to run it?
1. Click [here](http://cpp.sh/56ias) and follow the in-program prompts
2. Have fun and enjoy :)
